## Objective
This project sets up a lightweight, home-based Security Operations Center (SOC) using Splunk for log ingestion, monitoring, and basic threat detection.

## Key Components
- **Splunk Enterprise (Free Edition)**
- **Universal Forwarders on Windows/Linux hosts**
- **Custom detection rules for specific attack patterns**
- **Dashboards for visual threat monitoring**
- **Documentation for deployment and usage**

## Architecture Diagram
TBD â€“ add a simple network + Splunk flow diagram here.

## Use Cases
